# Vulnerability Report

This report is to provide some possible vulnerabilities that would have existed in the program’s code and safeguards or repairs put in place.

### This Audit report is based on OWASP Assessment List


## Sensitive Data Exposure
- Sensitive data exposure occurs when data is not secured properly.  This data generally includes names, passwords, profide information, or any other sensitive material that should not be seen by anyone other than the user.  All sensitive information should use an encryption with a strong hash that is sprinkled with “salt”.
- In the .NET-Core Framework, the strongest hashing algorithm in implemented using PBKDF2.
- DOES NOT: Store encrypted passwords.
- DOES: Use strong hash encryption with a minimum complexity password that use the full character set(numbers, symbols, and letters).
###### Repair:  
- The developers ensured to use external party [Autho0](https://auth0.com/) for Identity Management(user login and authentication).  Information the application receives back is if the user is athenticated to login, the user profile picture/avatar, name, and email.  Using the ASP.NET Core framework, this information is stored securly in a database to associate messages to the user.  No passwords are ever stored in the satabase.
